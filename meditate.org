* limitless
  Limitations live only in our minds. But if we use our imaginations, our
  possibilities become limitless.
* friendship
  Don't walk in front of me; I may not follow. Don't walk behind me; I may not
  lead. Just walk beside me and be my friend.
* ONLY YOU
  "Obstacles can't stop you.
  Problems can't stop you.
  Most of all, other people can't stop you.
  ONLY YOU can stop you."
                    ~Jeffrey Gitomer
